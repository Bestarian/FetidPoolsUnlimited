- This is just a small collection of scripts I made for fun.
- I do not take any responsibility for the outcome and any possible errors, I do belive it is save to use though.
- It is designed for the Epicgames version.
- I was not able to test the Steam version but do think it will work 

Steps for using: 
1. Check which charcter you want to use the exploit with, look in what slot the character is.
2. If the character is not in the first slot you need to rename the files in the Folder "Fetid Pools"
	- Replace the 0s in the filenames with the number of your Character minus one (Example: character in slot 3 -> 3-1 = 2, rename the files to save_2.bak / save_2.sav)
3. Execute BackupWorld & BackupCharacters (this one is optional).
4. Execute the Load script depending on your platform. 
	- Additional to doing the exploit, this starts your game.
5. select your character and load the Adventure, then collect everything.
6. Close your game and execute the Load again.
7. Repeat Steps 4-6 as often as you want. (Do not repeat step 3, you will lose your Campaing and Adventure Progress)
8. When you are finished start RestoreWorld.
	- It will restore your characters Campaing and Adventure Progress.
